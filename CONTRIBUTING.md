# Contributing to Dequarantine
Thank you so much for taking out your time to contribute to our project.
Here's a bunch of stuff that you must adhere to help us maintain our workflow:

## Workflow

#### Branches
We 4 major branches:
  * master
  * front-end-dev
  * backend-dev
  * mobile-dev
  
Except for master, all 3 branches are used to maintain the 3 major components of Dequarantine and are maintained by their respective 3 teams.

When you are working on a component of any of any of the 3 branches, make a branch on top of that branch. So, for instance if you are working on a login page; you create a branch called login on top of the front-end-dev branch and once you are done developing the login, you can simply commit the changes to your branch and once youâ€™ve reviewed those changes, the frontend team lead can merge the login branch with the front-end-dev branch, so that all the new changes (with login implemented) becomes a part of the main front-end-dev branch which is maintaining all frontend.

Once you've commit all the changes to your branch, the team lead maintaing the main branch will merge your branch with the main branch (one of the 3 branches). At the end of every month, we'll be merging all 3 branches with master.


## Issues

Issues are a good way for us to keep a track of our project's progress and discuss new possibilities. 
In the scope of our project, we will focus on two types of issues:
  * [Features](https://github.com/Saakshaat/dequarantine/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)
  * [Bugs](https://github.com/Saakshaat/dequarantine/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
  
You can find the templates for creating issues [here](https://github.com/Saakshaat/dequarantine/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).
If you are on the Dequarantine team, ensure that you assign the issue to someone, ideally a member of the relevant team. 
Also ensure that you assign one of the three labels to the issue, basis wherever the issue lies:
  * [frontend](https://github.com/Saakshaat/dequarantine/labels/frontend)
  * [backend](https://github.com/Saakshaat/dequarantine/labels/backend)
  * [mobile dev](https://github.com/Saakshaat/dequarantine/labels/mobile%20dev)
  
  
## Finally

Thank you so much for being a part of our effort to motivate people to stay indoors during this difficult time and help them get out of this isolation, emotionally.
