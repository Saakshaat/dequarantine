# [Docket](https://devpost.com/software/virtual-event-app-vea)

Docket is a flutter app that allows users to specify which categories of virtual events they're interested in, and those events will appear in a feed, with current/upcoming events sorted at the top of the list.

Event organizers enter their events into the app (Flutter), and they're ingested into the backend (Firebase).

Current categories of events include Work, fitness, mental health, and maker, but we're still drilling down the users to target for v1.

Everything's very-well built - a solid team of developers have been making this happen since day one, and we've begun reaching out to virtual event organizers, to start getting events scheduled & users onto the platform.
